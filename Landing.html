                <h3>
                    Chandrayaan is the name of India's lunar exploration program.
                </h3>

                        Chandrayaan-1 was India's first lunar mission, launched in 2008, which made significant discoveries about the Moon,
                        including the presence of water molecules on the lunar surface. Chandrayaan-2, launched in 2019, was a more ambitious mission that included an orbiter, lander (Vikram), and rover (Pragyan). 
                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, the Vikram lander's attempt to soft-land on the lunar surface did not succeed as planned.
                                Chandrayaan-3, if it were to be developed, would likely be a follow-up mission aimed at achieving a successful soft landing on the Moon's surface, building upon the lessons learned from Chandrayaan-2.
